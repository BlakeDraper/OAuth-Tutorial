# OAuth-Tutorial

Practice on OAuth using Github's API. This exercise goes through the steps of authenticating third party access to github and storing the access_token received using cookie session management.

This repo completes the tutorial that can be found [here](https://foundersandcoders.gitbooks.io/fac8/content/week8/workshop.html). 

Github's OAuth documentation was consulted to complete this exercise and can be found [here](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/).

Current Goals

* Learn how to encrypt cookies to make the access_token storage more secure.
* Use the access_token to query Github's API.
